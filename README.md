# Cura Marlin G-code Pauser

This program takes a G-code file, reads the number of layers, and inserts a pause command (M600) after a certain layer.

This program is specific to the Ultimaker Cura slicer, since it relies on it's commenting structure.

This program was built around the following resources: 
* Printer: Creality Ender 3 Pro
* Slicer: Ultimaker Cura 4.13.1
* G-code flavor: Marlin
